# ⚡ High Voltage Transformer Experiment (70kV)

**Repository:** `hv-transformer-experiment`

This project demonstrates a multi-stage high-voltage step-up transformer that outputs up to **70,000 volts** from standard 220V AC mains. It was designed for **educational purposes**, specifically to explore:

- Step-up transformer design
- Arcing and corona discharge phenomena
- High-voltage insulation and safety handling

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project involves **dangerously high voltages** that can cause serious injury or death. The setup was performed with extreme caution. This repository is for documentation and learning purposes only — do **not attempt this without proper high-voltage training and safety equipment**.

## 🔧 Project Overview

- **Input:** 220V AC
- **Stage 1:** Heavy-duty transformer (220V → 4kV)
- **Stage 2:** Custom-wound transformer (4kV → ~70kV)
- **Output:** Free-air arcing between terminals
- **Purpose:** Study arcing behavior, dielectric breakdown, and EM field properties
